# Single-Cycle-Risc-V-Processor-
Verilog implementation of a single-cycle RISC-V processor. Project includes a functional testbench and FPGA synthesis using Xilinx Vivado.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a **single-cycle 32-bit RISC-V processor** in **Verilog HDL**.  
The work was carried out as part of a laboratory project to explore a **novel, license-free, open-source instruction set architecture (ISA)** that is gaining increasing popularity in both academia and industry.

The processor supports the **base instruction set** with one additional custom instruction, and is capable of executing all instructions defined in the extended ISA. The design was successfully tested in simulation and implemented on the **Nexys A7 FPGA board** using **Xilinx Vivado**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Understand and apply the fundamentals of the **RISC-V ISA**  
- Design and implement the **datapath** and **control unit** of a single-cycle processor  
- Extend the instruction set by **adding a custom instruction**  
- Verify functionality using a **testbench in Verilog**  
- Synthesize and implement the processor on **FPGA hardware (Nexys A7)**
